The seller is particularly interested in identifying **trends, optimizing product offerings, and addressing any issues related to returned products**.

## Objective
The objective is to perform a **comprehensive analysis** of the provided Amazon order data using **Google Sheets** and extract **actionable insights**.

## Key Analysis and Approach
1. **Analyze the sales distribution across different product categories.**  
   - Created a **pivot table** to summarize sales across categories.  
   - Used **bar charts** to visualize category-wise sales performance.  

2. **Create a bar chart showing the top 5 sub-categories.**  
   - Filtered the dataset to identify **top 5 sub-categories by sales**.  
   - Created a **bar chart** to highlight key trends.  

3. **Create KPIs for Sales and Total Profit and compare with last year (i.e., 2016).**  
   - Used **SUMIFS()** and **YEAR()** functions to calculate yearly sales and profit.  
   - Designed KPI **cards with percentage change** to track year-over-year growth.  

4. **Create a KPI for Sales across different regions - North, South, East, West.**  
   - Used **SUMIFS()** function to calculate regional sales.  
   - Designed **KPI cards** to compare regional performance.  

5. **Analyze customer segments and their contribution to sales.**  
   - Created a **pivot table** to segment customers based on total sales.  
   - Used conditional formatting to highlight top contributing customer segments.  

6. **Identify the top 10 products that are frequently returned.**  
   - Used **COUNTIF()** function to count product returns.  
   - Filtered and displayed the **top 10 most returned products**.  

7. **Find the top 10 customers with the highest number of purchases.**  
   - Used **COUNTIF()** function to count total orders per customer.  
   - Sorted data to identify **top 10 repeat customers**.  

8. **Identify the top 10 most frequently bought items.**  
   - Used **SUMIFS()** to calculate purchase frequency.  
   - Created a **bar chart** for visualization.  

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis Tool**: Google Sheets  
- **Formulas Used**: SUMIFS(), COUNTIF(), YEAR(), FILTER(), SORT(), QUERY()  
- **Visualization**: Pivot Tables, Bar Charts, KPI Cards  

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the provided **Google Sheets dataset**.
